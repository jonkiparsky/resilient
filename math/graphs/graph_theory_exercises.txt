Graph Theory Exercises:

Note: I will be fairly informal in notation in these exercises. Some standard
notation will be mixed in with idiosyncratic and ad-hoc notation. Please let me
know what parts are confusing. 

Part 0:
In the following exercises, let A = {1,2}, B = {1,2,3}, C = {2,4,6}, D = {all of
the integers}, E = {}

#: For each of the listed sets A, B, C, D, E, name the sets (if any) that they
 are subsets of.
#: For each of the listed sets, describe a new set that that set is a subset of.
#: Prove that E is a subset of every set.

Part 1:
# Draw examples of each of the named graphs described in Part 1. Convince
yourself that the names make sense.
# Devise some other general graphs which might deserve names. Try to describe
their edge sets in terms of a vertex set V={v1, v2, ..., vn}.
# Consider the number of edges in C3, C4, etc. It should be obvious that for any
Cn, e=n, if n>2. Why do we need to make this exception?
# Try to characterize your new general graphs' edge counts in terms of their
vertex counts.
# Characterize the complement of the Null graph Nn and of the complete graph Kn
# Characterize the complement of the cyclical graph Cn.
# Describe the process by which we can produce a contraction of a graph. 
# Consider the following problem: There are three utilities (gas, water, and
electric) and three houses (A, B, and C) to be connected to those utilities. For
technical reasons (reasons of plot, if you like) connections are not allowed to
cross. Try to satisfy all three customers by connecting each of them to all
three utilities. Explain your results. 

Part 2:
# Prove that if G is isomorphic to H, then the complement of G is isomorphic to
the complement of H.
