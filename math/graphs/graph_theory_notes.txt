Notes on Graph Theory
---------------------

Part 0: Sets
------------
Motivation: sets are the fundamental building blocks of advanced mathematics. All
interesting math[1] begins with sets, and graph theory is no different

DEFINITION: Set
The simplest definition of a set is simply "a collection of entities", and this
definition will serve pretty well for our purposes here. 
Some further details:
* Set membership is boolean: Any entity either belongs to some set S, or it does
not. It is not "sort of" in the set, and it is not in the set more than once.
We can ask about any set S, "is the entity E a member of S?", and we can
ask about any entity E, "does S contain E?". (these questions are equivalent,
only the focus differs)
* An "entity" here means anything that we can talk about - any noun, or any
named or described object. For example, a set might contain Bob, nothingness,
and all things which can be characterized adequately in exactly seventeen words.
* A set imposes no ordering on its members. We can ask "is my cat a member of
the set S?", but we cannot ask "what is the first member of the set S?". This
being said, objects which have an inherent ordering obviously do not lose that
ordering as members of a set. "What is the least integer in the set of odd
primes?" is a perfectly legitimate question.
* A set can be viewed as a property, which an object either has (is a member of
that set) or does not have (is not a member of that set).

DEFINITION: Null set/Empty set
A set which has no members at all is called a "null" or "empty" set.

DEFINITION: Subset
Given sets A and B, we say that A is a subset of B iff[2] every member of A is
also a member of B, and we can write A⊂ B
* Example: if A = {1,2,3} and B = {1,2,3,4}, A⊂ B

DEFINITION: Superset
If A is a subset of B, then B is a superset of A and we can write A⊃ B 

DEFINITION: Set equality
We say that set A = set B iff every element of A is also an element of B.
* Note that this is equivalent to saying that A = B iff A ⊂ B and B⊂ A. This may
be worth a proof. If you think it is, prove it. 

THEOREM: Any null set is equal to any other null set
Proof: Let E and F be empty sets. Note that there is no member of E which is not
also a member of F, and vice versa. (That is E⊂ F and F⊂ E)
Discussion: Based on this proof, we will refer to "the" empty set rather than "an" empty
set, and we can use the symbol ∅ to denote this set.

DEFINITION: Complement
The complement of a set S with respect to some set U is the set
S'={s: s in U and s not in S}. That is, the complement of S wrt U contains every
element of U that is not contained in S. 

[1] by "interesting math" I mean mathematics as the study of structures rather
than simply a collection of techniques for efficient computation of numerical
values. Not to denigrate the latter, I'm just more interested in the former.
[2] "iff" is short for "if and only if". It is a very useful bit of jargon.


Part 1: Fundamentals of Graphs (Definitions)
--------------------------------------------
Definition: Graph
A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of two sets, denoted
V and E. V is a set of "nodes" or "vertices", and E is a set of "edges", or
connections between the vertices.
* The "vertices" of a graph most immediately stand for the "dots" in our
dots-and-lines graphs. However, they can represent almost any objects whose
relationships we are interested in modeling. 
* By convention, V is considered to be non-empty.
* An "edge" is a set of two vertices, v1 and v2, appearing in the graph's vertex
set. The graph's edge set E is a set of such pairs, eg E={{v1, v2}, {v2, v3},
{v3, v1}}.
* We use the lower-case "v" and "e" to denote the vertex count and edge count of
a given graph. For example, we might say "consider a graph G, with v>3" to
indicat that we mean a graph having more than three vertices.

Terminology:
* Given a graph G = {V, E}, with v1, v2 ⊂  V, if {v1, v2} ⊂ E, then we say that
v1 and v2 are "adjacent" in that graph.
* If v1 and v2 are adjacent, then we say the edge {v1, v2} is incident to v1
(and to v2) and likewise v1 and v2 are both incident to {v1, v2}.[3]
* Two graphs are equal if their edge sets and their vertex sets are equal.
* Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a way to rename the vertices of one of
them so as to make them equal.

Named Graphs:
* Given graph G = {V, E}, of v=n, with V={v1, v2, ..., vn}, we say that G is a
Cyclical graph on n nodes iff E={{v1, v2}, {v2, v3}, ..., {vn-1, vn}, {vn, v1}}.
We denote this graph as Kn - for example, C5 is the cyclical graph on five
nodes.
* Given graph G = {V, E}, v=n, we say that G is the Complete graph on n nodes
iff for all pairs v1, v2⊂  V, v1 != v2, the edge {v1, v2} ⊂ E. Write Kn.
* A graph G with n nodes is the Null graph Nn if its edge set is empty.

The Utility Graph:
* The utility graph UG has V = {A,B,C,X,Y,Z} and E = {(A, X), (A, Y), (A, Z),
(B, X), (B, Y), (B, Z), (C, X), (C, Y), (C, Z)}. This graph is named for an old
newspaper puzzle posed by Henry Dudeney in the early part of the XXth century.
(see exercises) 

Theorem: The complete graph Kn has n(n-1)/2 edges.
Proof:
Consider node v1. By definition, it is connected to every other node in V, hence
it is incident to n-1 edges. The same holds for every vertex in V, hence we
count n(n-1) "ends" of edges. However, each edge has two ends, so there are
n(n-1)/2 total edges.

Corollary: No simple graph with v=n can have more than n(n-1)/2 edges.
Proof:
By definition, all possible edges for n vertices appear in Kn. Therefore, no
edges can be added, and the edge count for Kn is the maximum number of edges for
a graph of n vertices.

DEFINITION: Complement
The complement of a graph G is the graph whose edge set is the complement of
G's, with respect to the complete graph on G's vertex set.[4]

DEFINITION: Subgraph
A graph G is a subgraph of H if the vertex set of G is a subset of the vertex
set of H and the edge set of G is a subset of vertex set of H.
* We assume that G is a legitimate graph, specifically that all of the vertices
appearching in its edge set also appear in its vertex set. 
* If G is a subgraph of H, H is a supergraph of G

DEFINITION: Extension/Contraction
An extension of a graph G is formed by adding a new node w to V(G), and then
removing an edge (v, w) from E(G) and replacing it with edges (v, x) and (x, w).
That is, we add a new node to the graph, along some already existing edge. 
* Formally speaking, we consider a graph an extension of G if we repeat this
process zero or more times. That is, any graph is an extension of itself.
* If H is an extension of G, then G is a contraction of H. 

DEFINITION: Degree
The degree of a vertex v is the number of edges incident to it. 

DEFINITION: Component
A component of a graph consists of the set of nodes "reachable from" some
starting point vs.
* For example, the graph G = {{A,B,C,D}, {(A, B), (C, D)}} has
two components: A and B form one, and C and D form another.

[3] I find it odd that there is no notation expressing "adjacency" and
"incidence" in a graph, but as far as I know, there is not.
[4] Note the slightly loose usage here: clearly I mean "with respect to the EDGE
SET OF the complete graph on G's vertex set. Sometimes we get a little sloppy. 



Part 2: Isomorphism

DEFINITION: Isomorphism
("isomorphism" has already been mentioned, here we try to formalize the notion)
A graph G is isomorphic to another graph H iff there exists a function F mapping
the vertices of G on to the vertices of H1 so as to produce a graph G' equal to
H.
* In other words, if we can make the graphs equal by renaming their vertices,
then we say that they are isomorphic
* Isomorphism allows us to consider the abstract stucture of a graph without
worrying about what it represents. This is a common and useful technique in
mathematics and in computer science,  leading in the latter to general data
structures and algorithms.


Some properties of a graph are preserved under isomorphism. That is, if a graph
has a certain property, all graphs isomorphic to that graph share it. Some of
these properties are:

1. Vertex count
2. Edge count
3. Distribution of degrees
4. Component count

The first two are obvious from the definition of isomorphism. Since the
isomorphic graph G' is identical to H, it has the identical vertex and edge
sets. Since the isomorphism is produced by a renaming of vertices only, the
counts of both V and E must be identical between G and G'.

The second and third are less intuitive. "Distribution of degrees" is simply a
count of the number of nodes in G with degree 0, 1, 2, etc. Property 3 tells us
that if G has n nodes of degree d, then any graph isomorphic to G will also have
n nodes of degree d. Similarly, if G has n components, then any graph isomorphic
to G will also have n components. Again, this proceeds from the notion that an
isomorphism is demonstrated by a simple renaming of nodes, which does not change
the structure of the graph, and emphasizes the identity of structure between
isomorphic graphs.

Part 3: Planar Graphs
DEFINITION: Planar graph
A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without edge-crossings. If it
cannot be drawn on a plane without at least one edge-crossing, it is non-planar.
* Note that planarity or non-planarity are properties preserved under
isomorphism. 

Theorem: a subgraph of a planar graph is planar.
Proof (intuitive): Suppose that G is a planar graph. Then any subgraph of G is
either identical to G itself (and still planar) or has had some edges removed
from it.
Crucially, we do not add any notes when taking a subgraph. 

Corollary: a supergraph of a non-planar graph is non-planar.
Proof (intuitive): Similarly to the previous, a supergraph of G has the edge set
of G, plus maybe some more edges. If G is non-planar, then adding more edges
does not change that.

Theorem: UG is non-planar

Theorem: K5 is non-planar
